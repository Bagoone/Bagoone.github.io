							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>The app will be developed with a focus on the elderly as the user group for route planning. Rather than a complex and flashy interface, seniors prefer simple, practical and easy to learn features. As people age, people‘s computing skills decline, so given the complexity of route planning, this app will help them to automatically plan the best route to reduce their mental calculation. It also gives navigation and travel advice in the clearest and most understandable way.</p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>During one of my car rushes, I discovered that the complexity of using current mapping software and the amount of mental calculation required to get my route planning results was making it difficult. It is not easy for me as a young person to keep my mind calm and calculate in a time critical situation, more tough when it is used by an elderly person. Nowadays, as life gets smarter, smartphones are developing at a faster and faster pace and more and more applications are flooding our lives. However, with these complex interfaces, it is difficult for the elderly to keep up with the times and adapt to using it. In Leps(2021)’s article, “The ‘left behind’ elderly in the digital age”, he illustrates “Among the elderly, the number of people who have access to the Internet is still small. According to the statistical report on China’s Internet Development released by China Internet Network Information Center in September last year, as of June 2020, the number of Internet users in China has reached 940 million, of which 10.3% are over 60 years old. This means that even though there has been a surge of 34 million elderly Internet users in three months, there are still more than 157 million elderly people who have never had access to the Internet.In the information society, they are often called ‘digital refugees’”. This indicates that the software will have a significant user base.
							</p>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>	o This is a mapping application, voice input the departure and target places, combined with the current time of the car, weather conditions, crowd congestion, help you plan the best route, and give multiple travel suggestions. Use existing map applications to implement map navigation functions, such as Google Maps, Baidu Maps, Gaode Maps, etc. And borrow the existing voice to text, get driving speed, travel congestion and other functions of Baidu Maps, using greedy algorithm for the current travel route planning. Automatically get the user's frequent address, and when the precise home address is not entered, automatically select the closest location to the current city's frequent address or public transportation stations such as airports and train stations as the destination.</br>
								o Combine bus, subway, plane and train schedules, current travel time information, and project the probability of delays and the frequency you can get on with the current weather conditions to give multiple optimal travel options, such as less walking, less time consuming, less transfers, and many other options. When the user wants to catch a certain train in a short time at a certain location and is in a hurry to calculate whether there is enough time, it will calculate the current probability of catching the train based on the current movement speed of the user, and when the probability is too low, it will give the suggestion of changing the train or changing to other transportation or booking a hotel nearby for one night immediately. If the transfer time is too long, it will give the suggestion of arriving at the play rest on the transfer route, which generally should not be too long and delay the next bus ride plan.</br>
								o Combined with AI intelligent robot so that the elderly can manipulate the application by voice, its search results can also be feedback by voice, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney, just choose to tell the robot from Melbourne to Sydney, the more accurate the location to give the more accurate results, if there is no accurate location, will automatically recommend the destination near the fun places and travel advice, or automatically positioned to the current city users most often go to If it does not meet the needs of the user, the user can simply call out the robot by voice and choose further locations for precise positioning.</br>
								o Combined with travel software, when recommending scenic spots to stop and watch or rest on the way out, or when passing a landmark, prompting the user the importance and playability of the surface and giving a historical introduction, and can give appropriate food recommendations. When approaching the destination, it gives real-time navigation directions, i.e. simple and clear arrow pointing, and reminds the user with voice how much further to turn left or right, or to cross the road. When arriving at the destination, it gives the walking time and the result of calorie consumption.
							</p>
							<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
							<p>	o Use Android software development platform software to develop software prototypes and shelves to Google play.</br>
								o python editing software to crawl data to get a collection of information about major traffic.</br>
								o Use a greedy algorithm to calculate the optimal path, based on the Baidu map Ran to read the phone's current walking speed and trajectory, and calculate the probability of being able to arrive on time.</br>
								o Use JAVA to implement AI speech to text, access to the voice recognition interface of Baidu cloud.</br>
								o Use JAVA to implement AI text-to-speech, call Baidu Cloud's text-to-speech API.
							</p>
							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							<p>I need to have experience in Android software development projects, mastering how to assemble various mapping software and implementing navigation functions with video and audio. In addition to this, I need to learn to use python to capture timetable information and the time spent travelling on major bus, rail, metro, plane and train systems, use big data AI data structures to calculate the best time to reach the destination at the current time and present it to the elderly in the simplest and clearest UI interface, and combine it with an AI voice communication system to tell the elderly the results.
							</p>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>If the software development is successful, it will help seniors to travel conveniently and allow more and more seniors to use smartphones, not just senior phones. If the popularity of smartphone applications for the elderly can be successfully achieved, it will help to bring the elderly closer to technological life, as well as allowing them to get pleasure from the internet and live a less boring life.</br>
								However, there are some possible problems in the development process including：</br>
								1. The protection of personal information.</br>
								2. Incompatibility of various transportation systems and difficulty in integration.</br>
								3. Insufficient accuracy of big data calculations, leading to impracticality of the best travel routes.</br>
								4. The inability of AI voice recognition to recognise the dialects of older people.
