							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>Smartphone customers should not only focus on the needs of young people, everyone has the day to become old, and with the development of technology, the elderly are increasingly unable to keep up with the pace of the times, technology is for people to live better, rather than people to chase technology life. This is a software to assist the elderly to travel. Considering the old people's blindness and unfamiliarity with the use of cell phones, this software combines map software, big data calculation, voice recognition and ticketing system to provide travel recommendation calculation services for the elderly in a comprehensive way. When the elderly travel to a certain location, it provides a full range of accurate recommendations and guidance services from the beginning of the trip to the destination.</p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>According to the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2019, China's elderly population over the age of 60 had reached 254 million, accounting for 18.1 percent of the total population. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, China's elderly population will exceed 300 million during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, entering a stage of moderate aging. The population structure is getting bigger and bigger. Among the elderly, the number of people who can access the Internet is still very small. According to the China Internet Development Statistics Report released by the China Internet Network Information Center last September, as of June 2020, China's Internet users had reached 940 million, of which 10.3 percent were over 60 years old. This means that despite a 34 million surge in elderly Internet users within three months, there are still more than 157 million elderly people who have never been online. In the information society, they are often referred to as "digital refugees".</br>
								The popularity of smartphones has rarely taken into account the suitability of smartphones for seniors, and while there is now software like Baidu and Google Maps to plan routes for us, there is no good collection of software that brings these features together to reduce the amount of thinking seniors have to do, and to help them get around using the simplest form of voice communication.
							</p>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>	o This is a mapping application, voice input the departure and target places, combined with the current time of the car, weather conditions, crowd congestion, help you plan the best route, and give multiple travel suggestions. Use existing map applications to implement map navigation functions, such as Google Maps, Baidu Maps, Gaode Maps, etc. And borrow the existing voice to text, get driving speed, travel congestion and other functions of Baidu Maps, using greedy algorithm for the current travel route planning. Automatically get the user's frequent address, and when the precise home address is not entered, automatically select the closest location to the current city's frequent address or public transportation stations such as airports and train stations as the destination.</br>
								o Combine bus, subway, plane and train schedules, current travel time information, and project the probability of delays and the frequency you can get on with the current weather conditions to give multiple optimal travel options, such as less walking, less time consuming, less transfers, and many other options. When the user wants to catch a certain train in a short time at a certain location and is in a hurry to calculate whether there is enough time, it will calculate the current probability of catching the train based on the current movement speed of the user, and when the probability is too low, it will give the suggestion of changing the train or changing to other transportation or booking a hotel nearby for one night immediately. If the transfer time is too long, it will give the suggestion of arriving at the play rest on the transfer route, which generally should not be too long and delay the next bus ride plan.</br>
								o Combined with AI intelligent robot so that the elderly can manipulate the application by voice, its search results can also be feedback by voice, for example, from Melbourne to Sydney, just choose to tell the robot from Melbourne to Sydney, the more accurate the location to give the more accurate results, if there is no accurate location, will automatically recommend the destination near the fun places and travel advice, or automatically positioned to the current city users most often go to If it does not meet the needs of the user, the user can simply call out the robot by voice and choose further locations for precise positioning.</br>
								o Combined with travel software, when recommending scenic spots to stop and watch or rest on the way out, or when passing a landmark, prompting the user the importance and playability of the surface and giving a historical introduction, and can give appropriate food recommendations. When approaching the destination, it gives real-time navigation directions, i.e. simple and clear arrow pointing, and reminds the user with voice how much further to turn left or right, or to cross the road. When arriving at the destination, it gives the walking time and the result of calorie consumption.
							</p>
							<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
							<p>	Android software development platform software to develop software prototypes and shelves to Google play
								python editing software to crawl data to get a collection of information about major traffic
								Use greedy algorithm to calculate the optimal path, based on the Baidu map Ran to read the phone's current walking speed and trajectory, calculate the probability of being able to arrive on time.
								use JAVA to implement AI speech to text, access to the voice recognition interface of Baidu cloud
							use JAVA to implement AI text-to-speech, call Baidu Cloud's text-to-speech API</p>
							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							<p>	Experience in Android software development projects and the method of assembling various map software to implement navigation functions in visual and audio form. In addition to this, learn to use python to crawl the major bus, rail, subway, plane, train system schedule information and travel time spent, use big data AI data structure to calculate the optimal time to reach the destination at the current time, and display it to the elderly in the most simple and clear UI, and combine with AI voice communication system to tell the elderly the results.
							</p>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>Help the elderly to travel, so that more and more elderly people are more convenient to use smart phones and not just the elderly machine. Possible problems: 1. protection of personal information; 2. incompatibility of various transportation systems, difficult to merge; 3. the accuracy of big data calculation is not accurate enough, resulting in the optimal route to travel is not practical; 4. AI voice recognition does not recognize the dialect of the elderly. If the realization of the popularization of the elderly can be brought closer to the life of the elderly and older people, at least the elderly can be closer to the life of the Internet</p>
