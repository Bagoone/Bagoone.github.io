							<p>Hello there, I am from Guangzhou, China and I am studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology in my second year. Before studying in RMIT, I majored in Computer Science for two years in Beijing Normal University in Zhuhai.</p>
							<p>I am 20 years old this year, and I was born in Guangzhou originally. </br>
								Regretfully, I have not been to Melbourne because of COVIN-19 but I really like it. If one day it opens borders, I would be the one who is the first one to fly Melbourne.</p>
							<p>I like traveling, photographing, camping and playing ball sports, like basketball, football, table tennis, badminton, biliard. In addition, I really like to do some work by hand, especially the Lego blocks. Every time I travel with my friends, I like to challenge myself by climbing and take photos to record these beautiful sightseeings. I still remember one time I followed a team to climb the Huangyang Mountains which are the highest mountains in Zhuhai. We spent a whole day climbing to the top of mountains and we camped there for one night. This is a special night I slept in a tent without a comfortable bed, without any warm quilts, just a moisture-proof mat and a sleeping bag. And there is no signal and electricity for our smartphone. What a boring and difficult night. However, the sunshine on the next day changed my opinion. When the first light shines on my face through the clouds,  an idea that all the effort I reached here is worth happened in my mind. From then on, I love climbing and camping, and going to more and more places to see the sights.</p>
