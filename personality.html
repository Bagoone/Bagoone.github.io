							<h3>Strengths</h3></br>
							<p>ENFJ - A (E-EXTRAVERTED, N-INTUITIVE, F-FEELING, J-JUDGING, A-ASSERTIVE) indicates that I am an outgoing, enthusiastic and helpful person. I will give more weight to my intuition, but I will make objective judgements in relation to the facts I observe, rather than jumping to conclusions based on my intuition 	alone. In addition, I have a strong sense of responsibility and 	when	I set my mind to something, I stick to it and get it done, so I can always get things 	done reliably.
							</p>
							<h3>Weaknesses</h3></br>
							<p>I tend to be too idealistic and whimsical and tend to overthink things.I also care too much about the feelings of others and can't realize if it's my fault and blame myself.Also, I always fail to assess my abilities well and sometimes I am not confident because I don't achieve what I expected. When I get stuck in a rut, I would stop and think about all the possible consequences to develop multiple solutions, but this may lead to delays in the project.
							</p>
							<h3>Works in team</h3></br>
							<p>In a team, I can learn new things quickly and perform many tasks well. I am open to others' opinions, which allows me to relate well to my colleagues.

							<p>
								I am not limited to learning styles. Observational learning, auditory learning and learning by doing are my main learning styles. I usually like to convert oral instruction into visual learning by taking notes to deepen my impressions, and can often notice visual details that others may miss.

							<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3></br>

							<p>
								In life, I am positive and not easily influenced by negative emotions and like to keep things in order. Although I am outgoing, I do not enjoy stimulating activities and it is important to me to have some space for my own solitary reflection. In terms of creativity, I am imaginative but will focus more on facts than fantasy. I love art and natural beauty and am open to new and exciting ideas.
