							<h1 class="major">Interest in IT</h1>
							<p>My interest in IT is on how the facility connects to my smartphone which is a type of technology called Internet of things, and network security of how to protect my privacy data on the internet. In fact, the first time I was interested in IT was just only in the algorithm when I was in high school. What appealed to me first was it was math related, and I love math so I came to learn about C programming with my teacher who we called him Cao sir. Before I learned it, I think IT, which is just code -- a string of characters, is very boring. However, when I saw the running result from the compiler when I just put a few lines of codes into the keyboard. How magical! So I started to be interested in IT. And try to join some computer competition. As I know about IT more and more, I touch many different types of technologies in IT, like robot, network, cloud technology, web, computer graphic, digital image processing, and so on. I could realize my interesting idea through learning about IT technology, which gives me a great sense of achievement. And if I have some troubles, I always can find many people on the websites to help me.</p>
							<p>And why I choose RMIT is because I like the easy-teaching-style in RMIT, and it is great at computer science, its ranking in computer is not bad.</p>
							<p>Following, I expect to learn more IT technology on cloud or network security, or IoT. As the development of IT, more and more data would be saved on the cloud and it's important to protect these data would not be thrilled. In addition, using IoT to make our life more convenient is also interesting.</p>
