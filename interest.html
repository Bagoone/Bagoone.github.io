							<h1 class="major">Interest in IT</h1>
							<p>My interest in IT is My interest in IT is on how the facility connect to my smartphone which is a type of technology called Internet of things, and network security how to protect my privacy data on the internet. In fact, the first time I interest in IT just only in the algorithm when I was in high school. What the IT interest me first was it math related, and I love math so I come to learn about C programming with my teacher who we called him Cao sir. Before I learning it, I think the IT which just is a string of characters is very boring. However, when I saw the result from complier when I just put in a few lines of codes. It is magical! So I start to interest in IT. And come to join some computer competition. As I know about IT more and more, I touch many different types of technologies in IT, like robot, network, cloud technology, web, computer graphic, digital image processing, and so on. I could realize my interesting idea through learning about IT technology, which gives me a great sense of achievement. And if I have some troubles, I always can find many people on the websites  to help me.</p>
							<p>And why I choose to RMIT is because I like the easy-teaching-style in RMIT, and it have a great at computer science, its ranking in computer is not bad.</p>
							<p>Following, I expect to learn more IT technology on cloud or network security, or IOT. As the develop of IT, more and more data would be saved on the cloud and it's important to protect these data would not be thrilled. In addition, using IOT to make our life more convenience is also interesting.</p>
